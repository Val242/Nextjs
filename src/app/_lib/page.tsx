/*
Private folders are super useful for a bunch of things
1. Keeping your UI logic separate from routing logic
2. Having a consistent way to organize internal files in your project
3. Making it easier to group related files in your code editor
4. Avoiding potential naming conflicts with future Next.js file
naming conventions
